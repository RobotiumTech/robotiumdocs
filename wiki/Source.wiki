#summary Source code is hosted on github.


==Robotium source code==

We use Git instead of Subversion for managing the source code, [http://whygitisbetterthanx.com/ for several reasons].


==Read Access==

To check out a copy of the source code for yourself:

{{{
 git clone git://github.com/jayway/robotium.git
}}}

Or see this project's github pages:

 http://github.com/jayway/robotium


You can browse the source code there, and even download a zip with the source code!

To learn more about Git, see for example http://github.com/.
