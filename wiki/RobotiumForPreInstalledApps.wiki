#summary Use Robotium on pre-installed application

With Robotium it is possible to run test cases on applications that are pre-installed. 
For this to work you need to resign the pre-installed application with the same certificate signing of your test project. That requires you to have a rooted phone as you must have access to the /system/app folder on the device. 

Observe that some pre-installed applications do not function properly when re-installed with a new certificate signing. An example is the contacts application (Contacts.apk) that does not show up when re-signed.
