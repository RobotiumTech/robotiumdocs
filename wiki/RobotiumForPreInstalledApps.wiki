#summary Use Robotium on pre-installed application

With Robotium it is possible to run test cases on applications that are pre-installed. 
You need to have a rooted phone to make it work as you will need to have access to the /system/app folder on the device. 

Observe that there are some pre-installed applications that do not function properly when they are resigned.
