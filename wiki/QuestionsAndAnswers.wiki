=== How do I get started with Robotium? ===

The easiest way start using Robotium is to go to our [http://code.google.com/p/robotium/wiki/Getting_Started getting started page.]

There you can download and run an example test project. When you have imported the example test project it might be interesting to have a look at its structure and the AndroidManifest.xml where the target application for the test is defined.  


=== Which versions of Android does Robotium support? ===
 
Robotium officially supports Android 1.6 and up.

=== Which functionality does Robotium support? ===

Please download the [http://code.google.com/p/robotium/downloads/detail?name=robotium-solo-1.7.0-javadoc.jar&can=2&q=#makechanges Javadoc] to see a full list of Robotium methods.


=== Is it possible to write a test case that spans over 2 applications? ===

No, that is not possible. In the AndroidManifest.xml you state which target application you want to test. An example of how it can look like:

 <instrumentation android:targetPackage="com.example.android.notepad" android:name="android.test.InstrumentationTestRunner" />

That means that the test project is locked to the targetPackage. Going outside of that target package is not allowed by the Android platform. Therefore you will need 2 test projects, one for each application. 


=== Can I use Robotium if I only have the apk file? ===

Yes you can. You do not need to have the source code. More information is [http://code.google.com/p/robotium/wiki/RobotiumForAPKFiles found here.] 


=== Can I use Robotium on pre-installed applications? ===

Yes you can if you have a rooted phone. More information is [http://code.google.com/p/robotium/wiki/RobotiumForPreInstalledApps found here.]
 

=== Can I use Robotium on flash and web applications? ===

No Robotium will not be able to handle the flash or web components, it only works with android components. You could send in clicks by using clickOnScreen() or assert that a certain Activity is shown but that is all. You will not be able to write tests were you verify or work with the web or flash components. 

=== How do I run Robotium tests from the command line? ===

By using this command:

adb shell am instrument -w com.android.foo/android.test.InstrumentationTestRunner 

Where com.android.foo is the name of your test projects package. More on this can be [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/test/InstrumentationTestRunner.html found here.]

=== Why do text and button clicks get wrong? ===

If this problem happens on one of the supported versions then try to add this tag to the test projects AndroidManifest.xml

<uses-sdk android:targetSdkVersion="YOUR_VERSION" /> 

Where "YOUR_VERSION" is 6 for Android 2.0, 7 for Android 2.1 and 8 for Android 2.2.

If that does not solve the problem then write an [http://code.google.com/p/robotium/issues/list issue report.]
