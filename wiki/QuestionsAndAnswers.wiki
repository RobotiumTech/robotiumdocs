=== How do I get started with Robotium? ===

Download the [http://robotium.googlecode.com/files/robotium-solo-1.7.1.jar Robotium jar] and add it to your test project's build path. For further instructions go to our [http://code.google.com/p/robotium/wiki/Getting_Started getting started page.] There you can download and run an example test project. When you have imported the example test project it might be interesting to have a look at its structure and the !AndroidManifest.xml where the target application for the test is defined.  


=== Which versions of Android does Robotium support? ===
 
Robotium officially supports Android 1.6 and up.

=== Which features does Robotium support? ===

Please download the [http://robotium.googlecode.com/files/robotium-solo-1.7.1-javadoc.jar Javadoc] to see a full list of Robotium features. The Javadoc is a jar file that builds on the zip file format. If you do not know how to extract its content you can rename it to .zip instead and extract it with your favourite zip extraction tool.


=== Is it possible to write a test case that spans over 2 applications? ===

No, that is not possible. In the !AndroidManifest.xml you state which target application you want to test. An example of what it can look like:

{{{
<instrumentation android:targetPackage="com.example.android.notepad" android:name="android.test.!InstrumentationTestRunner" />
}}}

That means that the test project is locked to the {{{targetPackage}}}. Going outside of that target package is not allowed by the Android platform. Therefore you will need 2 test projects, one for each application. 


=== Can I use Robotium if I only have the apk file? ===

Yes you can. You do not need to have the source code. More information is [http://code.google.com/p/robotium/wiki/RobotiumForAPKFiles found here.] 


=== Can I use Robotium on pre-installed applications? ===

Yes you can if you have a rooted phone. More information is [http://code.google.com/p/robotium/wiki/RobotiumForPreInstalledApps found here.]
 

=== Can I use Robotium on flash and web applications? ===

No. Robotium will not be able to handle the flash or web components, it only works with android components. You could send in clicks by using {{{clickOnScreen()}}} or assert that a certain Activity is shown but that is all. You will not be able to write tests where you verify or work with the web or flash components. 

=== How do I run Robotium tests from the command line? ===

By using this command:

{{{
adb shell am instrument -w com.android.foo/android.test.!InstrumentationTestRunner
}}} 

Where {{{com.android.foo}}} is the name of your test project's package. More on this can be [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/test/InstrumentationTestRunner.html found here.]

=== Why do text and button clicks get wrong? ===

If this problem happens on one of the supported versions then try to add this tag to the test project's !AndroidManifest.xml

{{{
<uses-sdk android:targetSdkVersion="YOUR_VERSION" /> 
}}}

Where {{{YOUR_VERSION}}} is {{{6}}} for Android 2.0, {{{7}}} for Android 2.1 and {{{8}}} for Android 2.2.

If that does not solve the problem then try to add this tag to the !AndroidManifest.xml of the application you want to test:

{{{
<supports-screens android:anyDensity="true"/> 
}}}

If neither of these solutions solve your problems then write an [http://code.google.com/p/robotium/issues/list issue report.]
