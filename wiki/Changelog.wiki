== Robotium 3.1 Released ==
Robotium 3.1 is now released. Most efforts 
have gone into improvements and also fixing issues that were 
introduced in the 3.0 release. Also, many improvements have been made 
in the activity methods. If you have had issues with 
finishOpenedActivities() then please try this version instead. 

*New Functionality:*
   * getView(Class viewClass, int index)   //Returns a view with a given class and index

*Issues Fixed:*
   * Some Issues..

== Robotium 3.0 Released ==
Robotium 3.0 is now released. This release is 
the fastest, lightest and most stable version of Robotium yet. More or 
less all the code has been modified and improved in one way or 
another, leading to a very stable version. This is an upgrade that I 
recommend everyone to do.  With this release, Robotium is now fully 
compatible with animation rich applications. No more freezes and slow 
downs when the UI thread is being used. 

One big change which breaks backward compatibility is that activities 
are now closed with the new method finishOpenedActivities(). 
Finalize() does not close activities any more. If you have used 
finalize() before, you will need to change that to 
finishOpenedActivities() instead. 

*New Functionality:*
   * finishOpenedActivities()  //Closes the opened activities (replaces inalize()) 
   * waitForText(String text, int minimumNumberOfMatches, long timeout, boolean scroll, boolean onlyVisible) 
   * waitForView(View view) 
   * waitForView(View view, int timeout, boolean scroll) 

*Modified methods:* 
   * finalize() does not close activies anymore! 
   * searchText() also searches error messages. 

*Issues Fixed:*
   * Some Issues..

== Robotium 2.5 Released ==
Robotium 2.5 is now released. Robotium now supports 
Android 3.2, Honecomb. Some minor annoying issues have also been fixed 
to improve the overall experience. 

*New Functionality:*
   * getText(String text, boolean onlyVisible) 
   * getButton(String text, boolean onlyVisible) 
   * getEditText(String text, boolean onlyVisible)

*Issues Fixed:*
   * Some Issues..

== Robotium 2.4 Released ==
Robotium 2.4 is now released! Most of the work in this release has 
gone into correcting defects and improving Robotium. The assert 
methods have been re-designed in order to improve stability. I want to 
thank everyone that have reported issues. They have all been corrected 
and Robotium is now better then ever! 

*New Functionality:*
   * waitForActivity(String name) which includes a default timeout of 20 seconds (similar to the other waitFor methods). 

*Issues Fixed:*
   * Some Issues..

== Robotium 2.3 Released ==
Robotium 2.3 is now released! It is mainly a maintenance release where 
the issues reported have been corrected. Thanks for reporting issues, 
that is what makes Robotium better for every release. 

*New Functionality:*
   * getActivityMonitor() which returns the activity monitor used by Robotium. Some users have requested the possibility to disable it in order to set up their own activity monitors

*Issues Fixed:*
   * Some Issues..

== Robotium 2.2 Released ==
Robotium 2.2. is now released! The biggest news in this release is a 
new constructor which allows for only the instrumentation object to be 
given: Solo(Instrumentation instrumentation). The Activity can later 
be started and Robotium will then pick it up. This will solve some 
problems that have been experienced when a swift splash screen has 
been failed to be recognized by Robotium as it happened before it was 
set up. Now the activity can be started after Robotium. 

Also the whole view fecthing mechanism has been modified and improved 
so that issues experienced with dialogs are solved. Changes has also 
been made to improve performance and memory footprint. 

I want to thank orrc and louth for contributing code and Naveed for 
contributing documentation. I also want to thank all of you who have 
reported issues. 

*New Functionality:*
   * Solo(Instrumentation instrumentation) 
   * clickLongInList(int line) 
   * clickLongInList(int line, int index) 
   * clickLongInList(int line, int index, int time) 
   * setSlidingDrawer(int index, int status) 
   * setSlidingDrawer(SlidingDrawer slidingDrawer, int status) 

*Issues Fixed:*
   * Some Issues..

== Robotium 2.1 Released ==
Robotium 2.1 is now released! This release 
not only brings new features but also a lot of internal changes and 
improvements. Most of the work in this release has gone into making 
Robotium better then before. The memory footprint has been reduced 
which results in a more effective and lighter version of Robotium. 
Furthermore the improvements that have been made to the whole scroll 
and view fetching functionality makes this the smartest Robotium to 
date. This is an update that I recommend everyone to do. 

This realse also makes Robotium compatible with very complex 
applications. The issues that have been seen when using Robotium on 
complex applications have been addressed and resolved. 

*New Functionality:*
   * waitForView(Class{{{<T>}}} viewClass) 
   * getCurrentViews() 
   * pressMenuItem(int index, int itemsPerRow) 
   * sendKey() supports any key event 
   * clickInList() has been completely re-designed to support all list implementations. 
   * Scrolling of scrollViews has also been completely re-designed to
increase speed and accuracy

*Issues Fixed:*
   * Some Issues..

== Robotium 2.0.1 Released ==
Robotium 2.0.1 is now released. The 2.0 issues have been solved and 
now it should work really well. It has been optimized and improved and 
it is definitely faster then previous releases. It also supports more 
(complex) applications. A lot of methods have been rewritten for this 
release. 

*New Functionality:*
   * setDatePicker(index, year, monthOfYear, dayOfMonth) 
   * setTimePicker(index, hour, minute) 
   * clickLongOnView(view, time) 
   * clickLongOnText(String text, int match, int time) 
   * setProgressBar(index, progress) 
   * Full support for ExpandableListViews 

*Issues Fixed:*
   * Some Issues..

== Robotium 2.0 Released ==
Robotium 2.0 is now released! In this release two major problems have been resolved. The first problem was that in some application all views were not found. The second problem was that finalize() sometimes did not successfully close down Applications when used in a tearDown. To solve these problems some parts of Robotium have been fully rewritten and 
improved.  Besides resolving these issues, optimizations and bugfixes 
have also been made. I am very exited about this release! 

*New Functionality:*
   * setDatePicker(index, year, monthOfYear, dayOfMonth) 
   * setTimePicker(index, hour, minute) 
   * clickLongOnView(view, time) 
   * clickLongOnText(String text, int match, int time)

   * Full support for ExpandableListViews 

*Issues Fixed:*
   * Some Issues..

== Robotium 1.9.0 Released ==
Robotium 1.9.0 is now released! This is a release where most of the 
work has gone into stability issues. After increasing so much in 
functionality ever since the first release, this work was needed in 
order to make the existing functionality perform well. Quality wise I 
am very happy with this release. A new method waitForView() has been 
implemented which more or less all the methods now use before trying 
to do something. The scrolling of lists has been completely re-done 
and now the scroll is not only very fast but also controlled and 
precise. 

*New Functionality:*
   * waitForView(final Class{{{<T>}}} viewClass, final int
minimumNumberOfMatches, final int timeout) Waits for a view a certain
amount of time and returns true or false depending on result.
   * enterText(EditText editText) enters text into an EditText 
   * clearEditText(EditText ediText) clears an EditText 
   * isTextChecked(String text) checks if a CheckedTextView or
CompoundButton is checked 

*Re-written functionality:*
   * ScrollList() that is now twice as fast as before and exactly one page is scrolled at a time. 
   * Multiple changes have also been made into various methods in order
to not only improve functionality but also performance and stability. 

*Issues Fixed:*
   * Some Issues..

== Robotium 1.8.0 Released ==
Robotium 1.8.0 is now released! It brings new functionality as well as 
many bug fixes and improvements in the existing code. I would like to 
thank my colleague Hugo Josefson for refactoring, improving and 
optimizing a lot of the existing code. I would also like to thank 
simudvarac for adding functionality into robotium to filter out views 
that are not visible. This is a feature that has been asked for on 
this forum. I would also like to thank RAI for contributing 
documentation. That is something that we need more of. Finally I would 
like to thank all of you for reporting bugs and problems which have 
been fixed in this release. 

*New Functionality:*
   * getButton(String text), getText(String text) and getEditText(String
text) which will return the view that displays a certain text so that
questions can be asked directly to the view object it self
   * getView(int id) has also been added which will return a view depending on its id
   * searchText(String text, boolean onlyVisible), searchButton(String
text, boolean onlyVisible) which will only search for visible views on the screen

index) will check if a ToggleButton is checked
   * isSpinnerTextSelected(int index, String text) and isSpinnerTextSelected(String text) will check if a spinner text is
selected 
   * sendKey(Solo.CALL) and sendKey(Solo.ENDCALL) has been added to the
existing keys

*Re-written functionality:*
   * enterText() that works in a whole new way now and will work much
better and faster then the last solution for entering text
   * scrollDown() and scrollUp() have been optimized and also now check for and locate a draggable area before trying to scroll
