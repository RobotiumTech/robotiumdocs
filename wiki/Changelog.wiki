== Robotium 3.1 Released ==
Robotium 3.1 is now released. Most efforts 
have gone into improvements and also fixing issues that were 
introduced in the 3.0 release. Also, many improvements have been made 
in the activity methods. If you have had issues with 
finishOpenedActivities() then please try this version instead. 
 
*New Functionality:*
   * getView(Class viewClass, int index)  //Returns a view with a given 
class and index 

*Issues Fixed:*
   * Some Issues..

== Robotium 3.0 Released ==
Robotium 3.0 is now released. This release is 
the fastest, lightest and most stable version of Robotium yet. More or 
less all the code has been modified and improved in one way or 
another, leading to a very stable version. This is an upgrade that I 
recommend everyone to do.  With this release, Robotium is now fully 
compatible with animation rich applications. No more freezes and slow 
downs when the UI thread is being used. 

One big change which breaks backward compatibility is that activities 
are now closed with the new method finishOpenedActivities(). 
Finalize() does not close activities any more. If you have used 
finalize() before, you will need to change that to 
finishOpenedActivities() instead. 

 
*New Functionality:*
   * finishOpenedActivities()  //Closes the opened activities (replaces 
finalize()) 
   * waitForText(String text, int minimumNumberOfMatches, long timeout, boolean scroll, boolean onlyVisible) 
   * waitForView(View view) 
   * waitForView(View view, int timeout, boolean scroll) 

*Modified methods:* 
   * finalize() does not close activies anymore! 
   * searchText() also searches error messages. 

*Issues Fixed:*
   * Some Issues..

== Robotium 2.5 Released ==
Robotium 2.5 is now released. Robotium now supports 
Android 3.2, Honecomb. Some minor annoying issues have also been fixed 
to improve the overall experience. 

*New Functionality:*
   * getText(String text, boolean onlyVisible) 
   * getButton(String text, boolean onlyVisible) 
   * getEditText(String text, boolean onlyVisible)

*Issues Fixed:*
   * Some Issues..
