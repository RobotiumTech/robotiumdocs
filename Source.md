## Robotium source code ##

We use Git instead of Subversion for managing the source code, [for several reasons](http://whygitisbetterthanx.com/).


## Read Access ##

To check out a copy of the source code for yourself:

```
 git clone git://github.com/jayway/robotium.git
```

Or see this project's github pages:

> http://github.com/jayway/robotium


You can browse the source code there, and even download a zip with the source code!

To learn more about Git, see for example http://github.com/.
